## Mactivision Mini-Games

Video games are experienced at many different levels; however, all games by
nature of being playable have some form of mechanical experience that serves
as first contact with the player. The mechanical experience of a game is
understood through the concepts of mechanical achievability. That is to say,
is it possible, given a player’s profile of cognitive and motor abilities,
that they can complete the game’s challenges?

The Games Scalability Environment (G-ScalE) is a research team that focuses
on understanding the fundamental science behind video games. Our capstone
team (Mactivision) has developed various cognitive tests disguised as
mini-games which will measure users’ strengths and weaknesses in performing
various atomic challenges (game tasks), each corresponding to different
cognitive and motor abilities. Each test is a play-through of a series of
mini-games, called a Mini-game Battery. After each mini-game, data is
recorded of the user’s gameplay, which can then be processed, by
researchers, to measure the user’s performance in the cognitive and motor
abilities being measured. Each Battery can be tailored to the researcher’s
specifications, and thus can be used to measure the change in a user’s
performance when using different mini-game parameters.
