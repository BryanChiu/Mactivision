##### **Mactivision Meeting #1**
All members attended.
Started meeting on discord Friday October 2 at 2:30pm est.

Notes from the meeting:

Understand cognitive and motor abilities.
Reading textbooks.
Kinesiology and other studies
How do you  map what is happening in the game to an ability.
How to measure the abilities.

Learn about a domain (Kinesiology, etc.) you don’t know about to fulfill the request.

Analyse the data. Mini game designed to collect data.

Overview of different abilities types

Fine motor abilities, require perceive motor control. Moving finger slightly. Big arm movements are less precise. We will be working with fine motor abilities because of covid and controllers we will be using. There will be a series of cognitive components for a given task.
There are research already on how to capture cognitive abilities. Compare how we capture cognitive abilities with other methods used before. 

Measurements:
Pressing any button when no stimulus appears
Pressing no button when the stimulus appears
Pressing the wrong button for a stimulus
The absolute speed of pressing. (Difference between appearance time and response time).

Choice reaction time task. Procedural memory.

There is no play element to traditional ability tests.

Specifically looking for reaction in games.

Choice reaction game in Super Mario Party is “looking for love”.
Finger pressing (motor)
Selective/focused attention (cognitive)
Not getting distracted, inhibition (cognitive)

What is happening:
Goal of the game
Mechanic
Score (Score is typed to how well they reacted to the stimuli)
Duration

Look for the in between actions. What actions take place in between actions and what actions are not being taken.

Beginning workflow mental model:
Understanding the details and nuances of the abilities
Figure out how to isolate and measure this ability
Figure out which abilities are coupled with the one you’re trying to study
Figure out how to mitigate the effects of those abilities
Design a mini-game for the isolated ability

Putting a playful interface on top of the test / challenges.

Constraints on game design and development. Single player experience, has to be done in unity and has to be designed in modular way (same game even if controller changes). We can use the unity asset store, scripts and plugins.

Next steps. Identify the set of abilities we want to work with. Understand what they are and how they interact and how they will be tested. 

Go to industry and pre evaluate games. All testing are post facto. We want to make testing pre facto. Understand where the difficulty of a game comes from. Currently it’s all based on prior experience. Try to pin down these kind of experiences. Where do theses challenges come from. Is it one thing or multiple things. If the designer wants to implement a design they will know how the design will interact with the abilities.

We are creating a pre test.

Sasha is creating a new challenge type. They. has a hypothesis what the difficulty should be for those challenges. To do this you need to pre test the players before the real experiment to get an idea of where the player’s current ability level.

End got is to have the measurement framework the same between the two teams.

We will tend to find 5 abilities that will tied together initially. From those 5 abilities we’ll be able to create a wide range of games. Each mini game would try to focus on 1 of those abilities. 

Setup a time for the next meetings.
