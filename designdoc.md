# Revision History

# 1. Anticipated Changes

* Mini-games will contain variables which will allow battery test administers/researchers to make small changes to the game's objectives and functionality. The number of variables from which the researchers can alter for each mini game will change over time as researchers think of new alterations for the games. In order to accommodate these changes each mini game will be passed a variable length dictionary of variables. This allows quicker additions or subtractions of variables and reduces confusion between researchers and mini game developer.

* The SRS document will continue to evolve throughout the life span of this project. It will be updated with changes discovered during the creation of a design document and for each subsequent major deliverable.

TODO(mike): Fill in A, B, C

* There are 46 cognitive and motor abilities available to measure as defined in our SRS.[LINK]. In the design of the three games listed in this document we have specifically targeted A, B, and C. Which abilities each game measures is subject to change as we create the games and test them with players. The measurement modules will help determine whether a game is accurately and meaningfully capturing the targeted abilities. If the game is not capturing the targeted ability in a significant way change must be made to the game or to the measurement module. Additionally, it may be discovered that some abilities are irrevocably linked and must be included in the targeted abilities list. Similarly, some games or measurement modules may be ineffective at measuring a specific ability within the scope of the project, in such as case, those abilities may be removed for the targeted list. These changes are expected to occur during the development of the mini games. In anticipation of this the design the games are kept simple such that they have a minimal number of game elements. Unity allows for these game elements to be module allowing for easy addition or subtraction from a particular game. Even eliminating an entire game design is a possibility. However, the module nature of the game elements will allow for reuse in any new design created as a replacement. This ensures that development of mini games is agility and can easily adapt to new discoveries in relationship between games and player abilities.

* Number of Unity packages will increase as development continues during the project. Thankfully, it easy to add and remove packages using the Unity package manager. Graphical and audio assets can also be managed in this way. This makes distributing the assets easier when sharing the unity project between team members and the final deliverable. It also makes it much easier to track which packages we have used over time, as each package and collection of assets have their on page on the unity store. This is particularly important for keeping track of the licenses of these packages to make sure they can be used in the project now and in the future.

# 2. Unlikely Changes

* JSON data structure is used as input to initialize the battery and as output for measurement data. This may change to another format, for example YAML or XML in future. This change depends on the needs of the researchers administrating the battery. As the data manager manages convert JSON files into a presentable manner it unlikely for research will want a change in data formats.  

* A database may be required to store the data instead of using JSON or other data structures in the long term. However, that is currently outside the scope of this project.

* There is currently no plan to include functionality to handle the scenario where the player stops playing the games during the middle of the battery. The administrator of the battery will have to decide if the data collected so far is sufficient or if the battery should be re administered. Similarly, any software crashes or bugs which halt the execution of the battery or any of the mini games will be unrecoverable. The battery application contains no functionality to recover from these errors only to report them to the user and administrator. All attempts will be made to make the software robust enough for this to be unlikely and for error messages to be helpful to players and administrators so they can make actionable decisions. Thankfully, the duration of the battery should be short enough that a battery restart is possible.

* A somewhat likely and unlikely change is the player input devices. Because of Covid 19 most of the players will be completing a battery using a browser and a keyboard. The supervisors of the project hope to be able to add more input types in future, however that will mostly be attempted after Mactivision has submitted their final work. Therefore, it is unlikely that keyboard will change before work is completed. However, since the future of the project will likely add new inputs all efforts have been made, now, to accommodate different input devices. Using Unity to abstract player inputs into actions like "left", "right" and "fire 1" instead of "pad-up", "right arrow", "trigger 2" make accommodating different yet similar input devices trivial. Different kinds of input devices like motion controls are mice can't be mapped to the ab

# 4. List of Modules

## 4.1 Measurement Framework Modules

This section of the document contains all modules relating to the _Measurement Framework_. These modules are to be implemented alongside the _Minigame_ modules in the Unity environment, and will be accessed by modules in the _Minigame_ set of modules.

## 4.1.1 Abstract Metric Event Module
  `abstract AbstractMetricEvent` Module 
  ### Uses
  * `System.DateTime`
  ### Syntax
  #### **Exported Constants**
  None
  #### **Exported Types**
  None
  #### **Exported Access Programs**
  |Routine Name|In |Out |Exceptions |
  |---|---|---|---|
  |`AbstractMetricEvent`|`DateTime`|`AbstractMetricEvent`||
  |`getEventTime`||`DateTime`||

  ### Semantics
  #### **State Variables**
  * `eventTime: DateTime`
  #### **Assumptions**
  * The constructor `AbstractMetricEvent(DateTime)` is called before any other access routines are called for that object.
  #### **Design Decision**
  This module is to represent an abstract class for all _Metric Events_. Every _Metric Event_ at least has a time stamp (`eventTime`) in which the event occurred.
  #### **Access Routine Semantics**
  `AbstractMetricEvent(et)`
  * transition: eventTime = et
  * output: _out_ := _self_
  * exception: none

  `getEventTime()`
  * transition: none
  * output: _out_ := eventTime
  * exception: none
## Button Pressing Event Module
  `ButtonPressingEvent` Module inherits [`AbstractMetricEvent`](#411-abstract-metric-event-module)
  ### Uses
  * [`AbstractMetricEvent`](#411-abstract-metric-event-module)

  * `keyDown: ùîπ` 
  #### **Assumptions**
  * The constructor `ButtonPressingEvent(DateTime,KeyCode, ùîπ)` is called before any other access routines are called for that object.
  #### **Design Decision**
  This module represents the `ButtonPressingEvent` class which can be instantiated by a _Minigame_ to store data relating to a single _Button Pressing Metric Event_. This object should be passed to a _Button Pressing Metric_ object ([`ButtonPressingMetric`](#button-pressing-metric-module)) for consumption. Every _Button Pressing Metric Event_ has a time stamp (`eventTime`) in which the event occurred, a key code (`keyCode`) representing the keyboard key which was pressed, and a key value (`keyDown`), representing if the key is pressed down or not (`true` indicated the key is pressed down).
  #### **Access Routine Semantics**
  `ButtonPressingEvent(et, kc, kd)`

  |`getPositions`||seq of `Vector2`||

  ### Semantics
  #### **State Variables**
  * `eventTime: DateTime` (inherited from `AbstractMetricEvent`)
  * `positions: `seq of `Vector2`
  #### **Assumptions**
  * The constructor `PositionEvent(DateTime,`seq of `Vector2)` is called before any other access routines are called for that object.
  #### **Design Decision**
  This module represents the `PositionEvent` class which can be instantiated by a _Minigame_ to store data relating to a single _Position Metric Event_. This object should be passed to a _Position Metric_ object ([`PositionMetric`](#position-metric-module)) for consumption. Every _Position Metric Event_ has a time stamp (`eventTime`) in which the event occurred, and an array of vector (`Vector2`) objects representing the positions of objects in the game. The names/ids of these objects are stored in the ([`PositionMetric`](#position-metric-module)) which will consume these events.
  #### **Access Routine Semantics**
  `PositionMetric(et, pos)`
  * transition: eventTime, positions = et, pos
  * output: _out_ := _self_
  * exception: none

  `getEventTime()` (inherited from `AbstractMetricEvent`)
  * transition: none
  * output: _out_ := eventTime
  * exception: none

  `getPositions()`
  * transition: none
  * output: _out_ := positions
  * exception: none

## Memory Choice Event Module
  `MemoryChoiceEvent` Module inherits [`AbstractMetricEvent`](#411-abstract-metric-event-module)

  * `System.DateTime`
  ### Syntax
  #### **Exported Constants**
  None
  #### **Exported Types**
  None
  #### **Exported Access Programs**
  |Routine Name|In |Out |Exceptions |
  |---|---|---|---|
  |`MemoryChoiceEvent`|`DateTime`, seq of `string`, `string`, `ùîπ`, `TimeSpan`|`MemoryChoiceEvent`||
  |`getEventTime`||`DateTime`||
  |`getObjectsSet`||seq of `string`||
  |`getObject`||`string`||
  |`getChoice`||`ùîπ`||

  * `eventTime: DateTime` (inherited from `AbstractMetricEvent`)
  * `objectsSet:` seq of `string`
  * `object: string`
  * `choice: ùîπ`
  * `choiceTime: DateTime`
  #### **Assumptions**
  * The constructor `MemoryChoiceEvent(DateTime,`seq of `string, string, ùîπ, TimeSpan)` is called before any other access routines are called for that object.
  #### **Design Decision**
  This module represents the `MemoryChoiceEvent` class which can be instantiated by a _Minigame_ to store data relating to a single _Memory Choice Event_. This object should be passed to a _Memory Choice Metric_ object ([`MemoryChoiceMetric`](#memory-choice-metric-module)) for consumption. Every _Memory Choice Event_ has a time stamp (`eventTime`) in which the event occurred, and an array of strings (`objectsSet`) representing the set of objects which should be answered `true`: ie., if `object` is a member of `objectsSet`, `choice` should be `true` if the user guesses correctly; `false` if the user guesses incorrectly. `choiceTime` is the timestamp the user made the choice, and `eventTime` is the timestamp the choice was presented to the user. If you subtract the two, the result is the time it took for the user to make the choice.
  #### **Access Routine Semantics**
  `MemoryChoiceEvent(et, os, o, c, ct)`

abstract `LevelManager` module inherits MonoBehaviour

### Uses
None

### Syntax
#### Exported Constants
None

#### Exported Types
None

#### Exported Access Programs
| Routine Name | In | Out | Exceptions |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Setup` ||||
| `StartLevel` ||||

### Semantics
#### Environment Variables
window: The game window

#### State Variables
`lvlState`: ‚Ñï\
`lvlCountDown`: ‚Ñù

#### State Invariant
`lvlState`‚àà {0..2}

#### Access Routine Semantics
`Setup()`
- transition: `lvlState`, `lvlCountDown` := 0, 5.0,<br>
   window := An introductory text is displayed over a blurred game screen

`StartLevel()`
- transition: `lvlState`==0 ‚àß `countDown`<=4 ‚áí
   `countDown` := decrements 1.0/sec,<br>
   window := Countdown begins, starting at 3.<br>
   `countDown`<=0 ‚áí `lvlState` := 1, window := Countdown is removed after 0 and game screen is unblurred

`EndLevel()`
- transition: `lvlState` := 2, window := The game screen is blurred and a "level complete" text appears. A button appears to go to the next scene (mini-game or main menu).


## 4.2.1 Digger Modules

This section of modules are used in the Digger game.

## 4.2.1.1 Digger Level Manager Module
`DiggerLevelManager` module inherits [`LevelManager`](#420-abstract-level-manager-module)

### Uses
[`PlayerController`](#4212-player-controller-module), [`GroundBreaker`](#4213-ground-breaker-module), [`ChestAnimator`](#4214-chest-animator-module), [`ButtonPressingMetric`](#button-pressing-metric-module), [`ButtonPressingEvent`](#button-pressing-event-module), {UnnamedJSONOutputter}, `UnityEngine.Event`, `UnityEngine.KeyCode`, `System.DateTime`

### Semantics
#### Environment Variables
`eventTime`: `DateTime`\
`e`: `Event`\
window: The game window

#### State Variables
`bpMetric`: [`ButtonPressingMetric`](#button-pressing-metric-module)\
`recording`: ùîπ\
`player`: [`PlayerController`](#4212-player-controller-module)\
`chest`: [`ChestAnimator`](#4214-chest-animator-module)\
`digAmount`: ‚Ñï\
`digKey`: `KeyCode`\
`lvlState`: ‚Ñï (inherited from [`LevelManager`](#420-abstract-level-manager-module))\

`digAmount`>0\

#### Assumptions
`Start` is called at the beginning of the scene.\
`Update` is called once each game cycle.\
`OnGUI` is called when a GUI event occurs (keyboard/mouse); it is called after `Update` in the game cycle.

#### Design Decisions
This module manages the majority of functionality in the game. The `digAmount` is the number of button presses required to finish the level. It rounds up to the nearest 10 (as there are 10 blocks to break in the level). `digAmount` and `digKey` have default values of 100 and the "B" key, but can be changed using the battery setup file.

`Start` is called at the beginning of the scene\
`Update` is called once each game cycle\
`OnTriggerStay2D` is called when a trigger gameobject is touching another gameobject; it is called before `Update` in the game cycle.

# 5. List of Changes to SRS

TODO(mike): Add links from here to SRS document

* Fixed general spelling and grammar mistakes that in the original SRS document.

* Added more specifics to the product / work scope. Added more information about the battery manager, the measurement modules and data manager. [LINK TO 1.2]

* Update the mini-game description to how long a player should be playing a game.

* Mini-games now have the ability for researchers to make small changes to the game's objectives by altering the game's variables.

* Include details about battery application and JSON data used to setup up the batter test.
* Added variable length dictionary of variables to mini games.

* Updated definitions, acronyms and abbreviations [LINK TO 1.3]. Added Battery definition. Removed database definition as it is outside the scope of this project. Updated vocabulary to be more consistent with the rest of the document.

* Updated references to include new research documents, websites and textbooks. [LINK TO 1.4]

* Updated Work Scope to provide more detail. Added work scope for three mini games, the battery module and measurement modules. Improved description of testing strategies. [LINK TO 1.6]

* Updated the product perspective to better reflect new separation of concerns between different parts of the project. Removed database information. [LINK TO 2.1] 

* Add battery application, data manager, and metric modules to product functions. Remove database information. [LINK TO 2.2] 

* Added "Free Platform Game Assets" and "JsonDotNet" as dependencies. The "Free Platform Game Assets" provides a while range of 2d sprites which can be used in a variety of different mini-games. A design goal is to keep the graphics style and avatar of the player similar between different mini-games. The "JsonDotNet" package allows for the transformation of C# objects to JSON objects making it terminal to modify data recorded by the metric modules.  [LINK TO 2.5] 

* Explained that admin users should be able to create a JSON file which describes a new battery. The file will contain the sequence of mini games that appear in the battery as well as variables that will make alterations of the mini games. Admin users should also be able to read and understand the data organized and presented by the Data Manager after a battery is completed. [LINK TO  2.4] 

* Updated the apportioning of requirements to break up "measurement framework" into battery application, metric modules and data manager. Removed database requirements. [LINK TO 2.6]

* Updated List of Stakeholders. Added McMaster University, TAs, game designers, and researchers/academics to the list of stakeholders. [LINK TO 2.7] 

* Update requirements to match modules in design document. [LINK TO 3]
    * Removed pause game and show score screen. After discussion with supervisor it was determined that these functions were unnecessary.
    * Renamed Database to Data Manager. A database will no longer be used to store data. Instead, a JSON file will be used to store the raw data from which the Data Manager will collect that data and organize and present it. 
    * Split Measurement Framework into Measurement Modules and Battery Application.
    * Added requirement that mini game start screen should contain instructions on how to play the game.

* User interface changes [LINK 3.1.1]
    * Removed database as a requirement to the user interface. Instead of recording and validating player identification with a database backend; the user identification will be put in a meta data header in the JSON data for the battery that player is participating in.
    * Users no longer launch individual games but launch the battery application which puts the users through sequence of mini games. 
    * Mini-game start screens must provide instructions to the player on how to play the game.
    * Removed concept of a main menu. That will now be broken up into the battery start screen and the mini game start screen.
    * Removed main menu example and added start and exit example.
    * Move error messages from the mini-games to the battery application. 

* Removed database from hardware interfaces [LINK 3.1.2]

* Changed software interface from database to JSON files. [LINK TO 3.1.3]

* Added present data and removed pause screen and score screen from functional requirements. Present data is required to make data collected readable to researchers. Pause and score screens are unnecessary as discussed with supervisor. [LINK TO 3.2]

* Removed database connection from Availability and added player time. A player must be available to complete a battery in one sitting without breaks. [LINK TO 3.3.4]

* Added player browsers as installation detail. [LINK OT 3.5.1]
