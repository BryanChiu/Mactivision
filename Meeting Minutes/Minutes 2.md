We will need to redo the requirements document as we work on the prototype and choose with abilities to work on.

Homework: Look at outside ability research to use as a model for our abilities to model.

We don't need pause features

Games should be short 30 secs

On failure, game ends.

On sucess, game ends.

We want to see fatigue values

No scores

Very simple end game screen just to let the player know they completed the game.

Players change behaviour when playing against players vs a computer AI.

If we had a games like stop and go traffic light
and you hit A on green light and B on red.
A user can always hit A and get 50%, but really they dont understand the game.

We need to know why the player is getting it wrong.

Have a que for mini games to have the player run through a games.

Testing pulling a pushing to git repo
